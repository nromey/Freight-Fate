# Contributing to Freight Fate

Thanks for helping make Freight Fate better. This project is audio-first and
accessibility-first, so contributions should keep blind and low-vision players
at the center of every change.

## What Is Being Accepted Right Now

Freight Fate 1.9 is in development on its own branch, and preview snapshots of
it will start appearing before long. Until they do, the 1.8 line is in
maintenance: pull requests are being accepted only for major and minor bug
fixes, not new features.

Feature work is still welcome in principle -- open an issue describing it, and
it can be picked up for 1.9 or later. This is about where the code lands, not
about the idea. Feature pull requests are welcome again once 1.9 preview
snapshots begin.

## Branch Targets

- Open feature, fix, data, and documentation pull requests against `dev`.
- Use `main` only for stable release, hotfix, or release-sync work.
- If your PR targets the wrong branch, a maintainer may retarget it before
  review.

## Before Opening a Pull Request

- Keep practical code files at or below 1000 lines. Split large code or test
  files into cohesive modules instead of adding more to an oversized file.
- Run `uv sync --group dev` before tests in a fresh checkout or worktree.
- Run focused tests for the area you changed. For broad or shared behavior,
  run the full suite with `uv run pytest`.
- Run `uv run ruff check src tests tools` and
  `uv run python -m compileall src tests tools`.
- For user-facing changes, include how you checked the spoken text, keyboard
  flow, or other accessibility impact.
- For player-facing changes, add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry (see Changelog
  Entries below); CI enforces this.

## Accessibility Expectations

- Every gameplay path must remain usable by keyboard and screen reader.
- Speech text should be clear, player-facing, and free of maintainer or CI
  jargon.
- Do not replace spoken information with visual-only cues.
- If you add or change menu items, driving prompts, warnings, settings, or
  status text, test the spoken result.

## World And Route Data

World data changes are welcome. Please keep them deterministic and offline:

- Route data must load without network access during normal play.
- Add sources or source notes for real-world facilities, stops, speed limits,
  tolls, interchanges, or other mapped data.
- Do not include experimental regions in playable data unless the index or
  loader explicitly enables them.
- Avoid raw OpenStreetMap tags or source-only text in player-facing names.
- After data changes, run the world and route tests, such as:

  ```powershell
  uv run pytest tests/test_world.py tests/test_world_overlay.py
  ```

## Changelog Entries

Nightly and stable release notes are built only from the curated entries in
`CHANGELOG.md` -- never from commit subjects -- so a player-facing change
without an entry ships silently. CI fails a pull request that changes
user-facing paths (`src/`, `docs/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, and the
release tooling) without adding one.

- Add a bullet under `## Unreleased` in the fitting section (`Added`,
  `Changed`, `Fixed`, and so on).
- Write for players, not maintainers: a bold lead sentence, then plain
  language about what they will hear or notice in the game. Match the voice
  of the existing entries; they are read aloud by screen readers, so avoid
  jargon, tables, and decorative symbols.
- A change with nothing player-facing in it (internal refactors, CI, tests,
  tooling) can skip the entry by putting `[skip changelog]` or
  `changelog: none` in every commit message of the pull request.

## Pull Request Notes

In your PR body, briefly say:

- what changed and why;
- what players or maintainers will notice;
- what tests or manual checks you ran;
- any accessibility impact.

Small PRs are easiest to review, but cohesive data restructures are fine when
the tests show the playable world still loads and routes correctly.
