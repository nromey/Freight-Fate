"""Screen reader output via Prism (the ``prismatoid`` package).

Prism is a screen reader abstraction layer that unifies NVDA, JAWS, SAPI,
VoiceOver, Speech Dispatcher, and many other backends behind one API. This
module wraps it in a small game-friendly interface that:

* never crashes the game if speech is unavailable (silent fallback),
* picks the best backend that is actually usable on this machine: Prism's
  ``acquire_best`` cannot be trusted for this -- it returns the highest
  priority backend that already has a live cached instance (whatever the
  game happens to be holding), and otherwise ranks by static registry
  priority whether or not that screen reader is running -- so the registry
  is enumerated in priority order and every candidate is validated against
  its live ``is_supported_at_runtime`` check,
* treats Prism's ``UIA`` backend (the route to Narrator, via UI Automation
  notifications) as a gated last resort: it reports runtime support on every
  modern Windows whether or not anyone is listening, so it is skipped unless
  Narrator is actually running -- and even then it only wins when no other
  voice works, because the backend raises every notification with
  ``NotificationProcessing_ImportantAll``, which Narrator queues without
  ever cancelling: interrupt and stop are no-ops, so menu browsing through
  it piles up unread items,
* keeps watching while the game runs: if the player switches screen readers
  mid-session (NVDA off, Narrator on, back to NVDA), a periodic health check
  re-detects the running one and reconnects speech instead of going silent,
* prefers ``output`` (speech + braille) and falls back to ``speak``,
* can be disabled with the ``FREIGHT_FATE_NO_SPEECH=1`` environment variable
  (used by the headless test suite and CI), and forced to a specific backend
  with ``FREIGHT_FATE_SPEECH_BACKEND=<name>`` (for example ``SAPI``).
