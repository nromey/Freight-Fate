"""Lane-guidance director: pans the EXISTING road bed toward the steer.

Pure logic, no audio calls -- the driving state feeds it the lane model and
the curve context each frame and applies the pan it returns to the road
noise loop. Keeping it a plain object keeps the cue logic testable headless.

The design is the community-resolved one on the roadmap (JaceK's audiogames
ruling, owner concurring, 2026-07-17), plus the owner's wake/sleep contract
(2026-07-27):

- Silence-is-centered: on a straight, centered and stable, guidance does
  nothing at all -- the road bed sits where it always sits.
- NO new steering tones, ever: continuous synthetic tones overwhelm the
  soundscape and hurt players with sensory or hearing issues. The guide is
  the EXISTING road/tire bed, panned along the arc.
- Pursuit, not error-nulling: the bed leans toward where the wheel should
  go -- follow the sound. In a bend it leads into the curve; in a drift it
  sits toward lane center. (Forza's audio steering guide panned
  engine+tires the same way; pursuit tracking beats error-nulling in the
  human-factors literature.)
- The guide wakes for exactly two reasons: drifting toward a lane line, or
  a curve inside its lead window (or underway). It slews home and sleeps
  on the straight.
- Drift cues stay underneath as the error backstop: the edge-boundary
  ladder (intermittent clip / periodic strip / aperiodic gravel) and the
  departure warnings, which grade by structure, not loudness.

``boundary`` names what is past the lane line on each side of the CURRENT
lane, so the edge sounds and spoken warnings can say the truth: ``lane``
(another lane of same-direction traffic), ``median`` (a divided highway's
left edge), ``oncoming`` (an undivided road's centerline), or ``shoulder``
(the right road edge).
