"""Packed sound assets for frozen builds.

Release builds ship the ``assets/sounds`` tree as a single masked pack file
(``freight_fate/sounds.pak``) instead of a browsable folder. The pack is a
deflated zip XOR-masked with a fixed key, so renaming it does not turn it
back into an openable archive; this deters casual editing, nothing more.
Source checkouts have no pack file and the audio engine reads the loose
files, so development is unchanged.

``tools/pack_sounds.py`` writes the pack; the audio engine reads it through
``open_default``. The pack payload is deterministic for identical inputs.
