"""Runtime audio engine: sound effects, loops, engine audio, and music.

Two interchangeable backends sit behind the :class:`AudioEngine` facade:

* **BASS** (via ``sound_lib``) — the preferred backend. The truck engine is a
  multisample ring: one real cab loop per rpm band, crossfaded equal-power
  with per-band playback-rate tracking (BASS attribute slides). When the
  licensed cuts are absent it falls back to the single idle loop pitched up
  with RPM. With no audio device (headless CI) it initializes BASS's
  "no sound" device, so the full code path still runs silently.
* **pygame.mixer** — automatic fallback when sound_lib/BASS cannot
  initialize. Crossfades the same four bands at their native pitch.

Set ``FREIGHT_FATE_AUDIO_BACKEND=pygame`` to skip BASS entirely.

Both backends degrade gracefully: if nothing can initialize, every method
becomes a no-op, so game logic never needs to check for audio availability.

Sound keys are paths relative to the bundled sound library, without
extension: ``play("ui/menu_select")`` plays
``freight_fate/assets/sounds/ui/menu_select.wav``.
