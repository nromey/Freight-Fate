# Sound and Music Credits

Sound effects in this directory come from a few sources, documented per file in
the tables below: original effects created for Freight Fate (no third-party
recordings or samples), weather and road loops produced with ElevenLabs sound
effects tooling, and -- in release builds only -- driving sounds cut from
commercially licensed sample libraries (see "Licensed Driving Sounds" below).
A number of in-cab cues were shared by Darren Duff early in the project; he
holds no license for that material (owner ruling 2026-07-22), so every Duff
row below is scheduled for replacement, not attribution -- most are already
superseded in release builds by the licensed overlay. The main menu, Open
Road, and Night Haul themes are Suno remakes created by the project owner. The July 2026 radio-station batch
(fifty-two tracks marked "2026-07 Zero batch" below) was composed with Suno V5
through the
Zero capability marketplace, with original lyrics written for Freight Fate;
those tracks are subject to the applicable Suno terms for the generating
account.

The default sound_lib weather loops were generated for Freight Fate with
ElevenLabs sound effects tooling, then reviewed and selected for the in-cab
weather mix.

The original project sound effects, and the ElevenLabs-generated assets
(original project assets subject to the applicable ElevenLabs terms for the
generating account), are part of Freight Fate and covered by the project's
PolyForm Noncommercial License (see `LICENSE` at the repository root): free to
use and share for noncommercial purposes, all other rights reserved by the
project owner. They are not dedicated to the public domain.

The in-cab truck sounds used for selected vehicle cues are authorized sounds
that [Darren Duff](https://darrenduff.com/) found, liked, and sent along for the
project. Darren also shared the louder/doubled-volume versions used for the
current idle, start, and shutdown cues.

## Licensed Driving Sounds (release builds only)

These assets ship inside release builds via the local `sounds-licensed/`
overlay and are never committed to the repository: they are cut from
commercially licensed sample-library recordings (Splice subscriptions held by
the project maintainers) whose license covers synchronized use in the finished
game but is per-seat and non-transferable, so the source samples cannot be
redistributed. A source checkout falls back to the committed cues above.
