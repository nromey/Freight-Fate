"""Optional online presence: an opt-in "on duty" heartbeat to orinks.net.

This module is the *only* place that knows about the Orinks presence API.
Gameplay code reports the same broad :class:`PresenceState` snapshots it
already builds for Discord Rich Presence; this service posts the latest one
to the live drivers board while the player is hauling, and clears it when
they stop. The board then shows lines like "Road Star -- Driving: Chicago to
Dallas -- steel coils, 45% there".

Everything here is best-effort and non-fatal by design, mirroring
:mod:`freight_fate.discord_presence`: if the player is offline, the site is
down, or the feature is disabled, the game plays exactly as before. All
network I/O runs on a background thread and no error ever propagates into
the game loop.

Privacy: the feature is off by default and only ever sends the broad
activity strings above, authenticated by account-issued credentials the
player copies from the Orinks driver setup page and pastes into the game
once (see :func:`verify_identity`). The driver's display name lives on the
site, tied to their Orinks account; the game never transmits profile names,
save data, or anything about the real player. Every request's User-Agent
does carry the game's build identity (see :func:`client_version`) so the
site can tell which release a post came from -- moderation and bug triage
data, never shown publicly.
