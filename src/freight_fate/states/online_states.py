"""Menus for the orinks.net drivers board: setup flow and the live list.

Setup follows the account model: the player signs in on orinks.net, the
site's driver setup page issues a public Driver ID and a one-time posting
token, and the player copies each into the clipboard and pastes it here.
Nothing is transmitted until the player activates "Connect and save", and
the spoken disclosure below tells them exactly what sharing will send.

All network calls run on daemon threads; the menu states poll a small result
slot from ``update`` so the game loop and speech stay responsive throughout.
