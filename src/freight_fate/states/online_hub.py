"""The Online menu: every online feature in one place on the main menu.

These items used to live in Settings under an Online category, which buried
actions a player reaches for by name -- "restore my save on this new
computer", "who is hauling right now" -- behind a settings hunt. The hub
keeps each consent toggle next to the account item that gives it meaning,
and the drivers board sits first because viewing it shares nothing.

Toggles keep the Settings adjust model (Enter or Right changes forward,
Left changes backward) so nothing moves under a player's fingers; action
rows ignore Left and Right the same way the old category did.
