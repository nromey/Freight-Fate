# Freight Fate Roadmap

> Current stable: **1.8.7** (shipped 2026-07-30). Next release: **1.9.0**, in
> flight on the `feat/career-1.9` branch, whose ROADMAP carries the full
> 1.9-in-flight feature view; it lands here when that line merges for
> release. After this stable release, `pyproject` on `dev` advances to
> 1.8.8.dev0 for nightly snapshots. Keep
> this file current: when a feature lands, check it off or add it in the
> same change (see the Roadmap upkeep section in `AGENTS.md`).

## Shipped in 1.6.0

- [x] Realistic freight markets and facilities: metro route nodes now expand
      into hundreds of representative shippers and receivers, with stable
      facility IDs, ship/receive cargo roles, regional specialization, curated
      source notes, deterministic offline templates, and save-compatible
      facility-aware job generation.
- [x] Playable air-brake pressure mechanics: cold starts need a short air
      build before the parking brake can release, service-brake applications
      consume air, parked engine-off time bleeds reservoir pressure (issue
      #79), low-air and spring-brake thresholds are spoken, and active trip
      saves preserve the air-brake state.
- [x] Dedicated air-system audio assets: the compressor-ready cue now plays a
      real air-dryer purge (`vehicle/air_dryer_purge.ogg`) and the low-air /
      spring-brake warnings a low-air buzzer (`vehicle/low_air_buzzer.ogg`),
      both ElevenLabs-generated; the spoken cues are kept for accessibility.

## Realism and polish pass (1.7.0 shipped, 1.8.0 in flight)

A consolidation pass focused on closing realism gaps and removing rough
edges rather than adding new systems. Much of it shipped in **1.7.0**
(player-feedback UX, dispatcher pay advances, relaxed mode, grounded
hazards, drowsiness, truck-legal HGV routing); the 1.7.0 CHANGELOG is the
source of truth for that release's exact contents. The **1.8.0** batch on
the `awesome-greider` branch -- pending merge -- adds the trooper pull-overs,
real OSM `maxspeed` baked per leg, corridor/real speed limits, seasons and a
temperature model, cargo-weight physics, immediate speeding-cost cues, the
S/A/U info keys, the HTML manual, and limit-aware (predictive) adaptive
cruise. Checkboxes below mark what is implemented; which release each lands
in is 1.7.0 or 1.8.0 per the split above. Several items overlap the trooper
milestone below (speeding consequences especially).

### Player feedback round (accessibility/UX)

From a batch of player reports:

- [x] **Driving keys did nothing under JAWS without JAWS Key+3 -- FIXED
  2026-08-24 (player report relayed by Norm, 1.8.8).** JAWS binds the
  arrows to its own scripts in every application, swallows the physical
  key, and re-sends it as an instant press-and-release pair, once per
  keyboard auto-repeat; driving polls `pygame.key.get_pressed()` and
  never saw a hold (menus react to the press event, so they worked).
  `held_keys.py` turns the pair train back into a hold, OR'd with SDL's
  own state so the physical-keyboard path is byte-for-byte what it was.
  Measured with `tools/key_probe.py` on Norm's JAWS machine the same day:
  first repeat at the Windows delay (512 ms), then pairs every ~250 ms
  (242-272) -- JAWS's script, not the 33 ms Windows rate -- so the
  tracker learns the spacing from the pairs themselves and sizes the
  hold to it; release reads ~370 ms late under JAWS, the price of a
  four-a-second poll.
- [ ] Under a key-re-sending screen reader a tap cannot be told from a
  hold until the first auto-repeat, so tap-length gestures (1.9's
  double-tap-and-hold pedal latch) are invisible through JAWS; a gesture
  counted in press events would see them. Second JAWS machine's probe
  log would confirm the ~250 ms spacing is JAWS-typical, not Norm's box.
- [x] **Map screen read raw data keys for the route -- FIXED 2026-07-21
  (NVDA player report).** Its first line joined the world's city slugs, so an
  east-coast run opened with "new underscore york underscore n y underscore u
  s" for all thirteen cities; every other screen already composed spoken names.
  Same pass singularized spoken measurements ("1 mile", not "1 miles") on one
  shared helper. The reporter's snapshot also predated 36a7f8e, which is why
  the map listed the same shared-city facility twice and pushed real stops off
  the five-item list.
- [ ] Unresolved half of that report: stop lines on the Map screen "make the
  sound but not letting me fully read" under NVDA. Not reproducible from the
  code -- the list is built once, nothing under the menu updates, and no path
  interrupts or drops an utterance. Needs the reporter's `logs/game.log` from a
  snapshot newer than 2026-07-21 to tell "the game never spoke it" from "NVDA
  never spoke it"; packaged builds have always written that transcript, and
  Settings, Problem reports now tells a player where to find it.
- [x] **Destination exit offered a state early on rural-highway finishes --
  FIXED 2026-07-16 (player transcripts).** The destination-exit scan accepted
  the last labeled interchange anywhere on the route, so routes whose final
  legs are unbaked rural highways (US-281 into Lampasas, US-2 across the
  plains to Havre) crowned an exit hundreds of miles out -- worst case 1,158
  miles, I-39 in Wisconsin for a Havre, Montana receiver -- and taking it
  settled the delivery from there. The scan now only accepts exits within the
  final 25 miles of the route and otherwise falls back to the synthetic
  end-of-route exit. Regression test pinned on both transcript routes.
- [ ] Bake labeled exits or junction cues for rural US-highway final
  approaches so arrivals there can name a real exit instead of the generic
  end-of-route fallback (follow-up to the 2026-07-16 destination-exit fix;
  needs an OSM junction sweep over non-motorway trunk corridors). Scale,
  measured 2026-07-16: 533 of 1,287 legs carry no labeled interchange, and
  192 of 623 cities have none on any approach leg, so every arrival there
  uses the generic fallback. A seeded 2,489-route sample of supported routes
  found 44 percent previously misfired the destination exit by more than 25
  miles (worst sampled: Payson, Arizona to Newport, Oregon, 1,152 miles
  early on a 1,420-mile route); all of those now take the fallback this
  sweep would upgrade. Regen should run offline from the cached PBFs like
  the overlay pipeline, targeting trunk/primary junction nodes on the 533
  unlabeled legs.
- [x] **Loading a career cut off its own welcome -- FIXED 2026-08-05.**
  Continue latest career and Choose career spoke "Welcome back" and then
  pushed the city menu, whose own "Parked at..." announcement interrupted and
  cancelled it before a player heard where they were or how much money they
  had. Same defect as the 2026-08-05 orinks.net-offer fix (`8baae687`),
  applied to the load path via `CityMenuState`'s existing one-shot
  `queue_entry_announcement`.
- [ ] Same welcome-truncation defect remains open on two rarer hand-offs out
  of Continue/Choose career: resuming an in-progress pickup (`PickupFacilityState`,
  which still announces with `interrupt=True`) and a pending save notice
  (`SaveMigrationNoticeState` / `SaveModifiedNoticeState`, same default).
  Both would need their own one-shot queue flag, mirroring `CityMenuState`'s;
  left out of the 2026-08-05 fix as lower-value (the lost line is just the
  short "Welcome back, name" greeting, not new information) and higher-risk
  to thread through `_world_entry_state`'s snapshot-resume branches untested.
- [x] **State lines repeated at intermediate cities -- FIXED 2026-07-19
  (player transcript).** Mapped state-boundary cues are now authoritative, so
  passing the next major city no longer claims that the truck crossed the same
  state line again. City narration retains the old crossing wording only as a
  fallback for legacy legs without mapped boundaries. Full harness regressions
  cover Tennessee and Texas routes, reverse travel, and an all-Texas route.
- [x] **Terrain labels read real relief -- LANDED 2026-07-22 (nromey,
  PR #107).** Grade segments were labeled mountain from point steepness alone,
  so a single creek-crossing roller in flat country read as mountains in the
  status readout. Labels are now reclassified from the relief-aware sweep
  computed on the 1.9 line (18,638 false-mountain segments corrected
  network-wide, 166 leg summaries promoted, no curated corridor downgraded).
  Labels only; `avg_grade_pct` and everything physics reads is untouched.
- [ ] Reconcile checkpoint positions with state-boundary positions on seven
  corridor legs. A 24-route forward/reverse harness sweep found 13 places
  spoken on the wrong side of a state line: Fort Oglethorpe on
  Nashville--Atlanta; Peekskill, Newburgh, Kingston, Ravena, Rotterdam, and
  Amsterdam on New York--Buffalo; North East and Conneaut on
  Buffalo--Cleveland; Mesquite on Las Vegas--Salt Lake City; the Longview--
  Portland corridor checkpoint; Ashland on Portland--San Francisco; and
  Vernal on Denver--Salt Lake City. This is a route-data ordering issue, not
  another city-narration composition bug.
- [x] **Quick info keys.** S reads the posted speed limit (was buried in the
  Tab menu); A repeats the last route announcement; U reads what is coming
  up (imposed limits, stops, exits ahead); R answers "where am I" in two
  short sentences -- progress and distance left (to a planned stop when one
  is set), then the road, the state, and the city it is taking you toward.
- [x] **Stop details and planned stops (1.8.x nightly).** Enter on a Map-screen
  stop opens a job-details-style view (exit, distance, offers, parking, and an
  ELD-rule ETA with an arrive-before-your-next-HOS-limit note), with plan /
  cancel / supersede buttons. The planned stop is announced with a "Planned
  stop" prefix at every surface that names stops (5-mile exit announcement,
  U key, C-key next-legal-stop, Map screen), persists in the active-trip
  snapshot, and clears itself when taken or passed.
- [x] **Announcement priority and lead time.** Safety cues (zone entry,
  construction/traffic warnings, checkpoints) preempt ambient chatter on the
  event voice instead of queuing behind it; zone warnings lead by real time
  (scaled by speed and `time_scale`) instead of a flat 2 miles that compressed
  to a few seconds at highway speed.
- [x] **Directional lane-drift rumble.** Shipped: `AudioEngine.play` takes a
  `pan` argument (BASS `BASS_ATTRIB_PAN`, with a stereo-volume fallback for the
  pygame backend), and the lane rumble sets it from `lane.offset` so the strip
  sounds from the side you drifted toward. Follow-up if wanted: pan other
  lateral cues (e.g. a lead vehicle to one side) the same way.
- [x] **Consultable keys reference.** Shipped: the pause menu's "Controls and
  help" opens the navigable how-to-play reference straight to the driving-keys
  page (`controls_help_page()` + `HelpState(start_page=...)`), so the key list
  is reachable mid-drive instead of only the F1 firehose; the keys page now
  lists S/A/U. The manual is also exported to `USER_MANUAL.html` (a small
  dependency-free Markdown->HTML converter, `tools/manual_html.py`) and shipped
  in portable builds beside `USER_MANUAL.md`.
- [x] **Drivers board reachable from the pause menu.** The "Drivers board"
  item now sits in the pause menu (between Settings and Abandon job), so a
  player can see who is hauling mid-drive without quitting to the main menu.
  Viewing shares nothing about the paused driver.
- [x] **Metric units applied consistently.** The units setting converted the
  driving cues but not the dispatch board, job details, pay rate, departure and
  deadhead summaries, exit and hazard callouts, pickup distance, delivery
  summary, career stats, or the on-screen HUD, so a metric player heard
  kilometers on the road and miles everywhere else. All of those now go through
  the shared `units` helpers, and `sim.trip` delegates to them too rather than
  keeping its own copy of the conversion (one of which used a rounded factor)
  (PR #142).
- [ ] **Remaining imperial-only readouts.** Fuel is always gallons and a price
  per gallon, air pressure is always psi, and `weather.describe` omits the
  "Fahrenheit" that `season.py` says, so its temperature reads bare "degrees".
  Adding litres, bar/kPa, and a consistent temperature phrase is a feature
  rather than a units-setting bug, so it wants its own pass on the 1.9 line.
- [ ] **Ambient-cue spacing (anti-stacking).** Priority handling fixes the
  critical case; still worth spacing or coalescing simultaneous low-priority
  cues so a burst of chatter does not pile up. Lower priority than the above.
- Confirmed-good: routing announcements through the SAPI event voice avoids
  contention with the player's primary screen reader; keep it the recommended
  default and documented.

### Driver economics

- [x] **Negative-balance recovery (softlock fix).** Shipped as a
  **dispatcher pay advance**: from the terminal hub or any in-trip rest
  stop, a broke driver (cash under $400) can draw $500 against the next
  load, capped at $1,500 outstanding, repaid automatically out of the next
  delivery settlement (never below zero, remainder carried). Tracked on
  `Profile.pay_advance`; deterministic and save-compatible. Money still
  goes negative freely for fines/tows by design, but broke-and-empty is no
  longer a dead end.
- [x] **Advances count toward lifetime earnings.** Settlement was crediting
  `total_earnings` with the post-repayment remainder, so advanced dollars
  were cash the career could not account for and cloud upload screening
  refused the save and stamped a sticky integrity flag. Lifetime earnings
  now book the whole settlement.
- [x] **Review integrity flags stamped before that fix.** All five production
  flags were cleared by hand on 2026-07-20. One (a level 2 career, four
  deliveries) was a false positive with no sign of an edit; the other four
  had been confirmed separately by offline forensics and were cleared as a
  deliberate amnesty.
- [x] **Stop screening from branding accounts on arithmetic alone.** A failed
  money or XP check now rejects the upload and keeps the payload for review
  instead of stamping a sticky flag that hid the driver until a human
  cleared it. Flags are still available by hand, from evidence. Both rules
  were wrong in the accusing direction: the XP ceiling was a copied 1.2 per
  mile sitting exactly on what a spotless career earns, and the money check
  priced owned equipment as if it had all been bought.
- [x] **Cloud screening reads the economy from the game.** Starting cash, the
  advance cap, and the XP rates ship in the exported invariants rather than
  being kept by hand on the server, so a balance pass cannot silently turn
  the rules against honest drivers.
- [ ] **Carry the same fixes onto the 1.9 line.** The career arc changes the
  XP model (flat per-delivery XP plus class, streak, and condition
  multipliers) and adds the owner-operator buy-in, where a driver takes
  title to a carrier tractor worth far more than the buy-in. Regenerate the
  exported invariants for save version 11 before 1.9 ships — the server
  gate matches on exact save version, so an un-regenerated export rejects
  every 1.9 backup.

### Fatigue and driver responsibility

- [x] **Drowsiness consequences.** Shipped: at severe fatigue
  (`FATIGUE_SEVERE`, 80+) the driver involuntarily nods off on a shrinking
  interval. Each microsleep plays a rumble-strip jolt with a short reaction
  window; steering or braking catches it (works with steering-assist off),
  but missing it drifts off the road for damage and scrubbed speed, and a
  third consecutive miss forces a stop. Independent of HOS mode (fatigue is
  physiological), so in relaxed mode -- where hazards are rare -- managing
  fatigue, fuel, and rest becomes the core of the drive. Possible follow-up:
  a dedicated microsleep/yawn audio asset instead of reusing the rumble strip.

- [x] **Relaxed mode should feel relaxed.** Shipped: `Trip` now takes a
  `hazard_scale` and relaxed mode passes `hos.hazard_scale("relaxed")`
  (0.2), so random road hazards are ~5x rarer while weather and night
  still modulate the ones that occur. Driver-responsibility systems
  (hours of service, fueling, repairs, fatigue) carry the relaxed loop;
  `realistic` mode is unchanged. Patrol windows already scale by
  `hazard_scale`; ambient traffic density (`_leg_traffic_density`) and the
  random roadside log-check odds (`_random_inspection_odds`) now do too, so a
  relaxed run is genuinely quieter on the road. Fixed weigh-station and
  construction-zone enforcement stay put -- a real violation still catches you.

- [x] **Grounded, context-aware hazards.** Shipped: the flat per-region
  string pool (which could announce farm equipment merging onto a freeway
  or a dust devil on a clear day) is replaced by a tagged `HAZARDS`
  catalog and `eligible_hazards(region, weather, terrain, hour)`. A hazard
  is only drawn when region, weather, terrain, *and* time of day all allow
  it: standing water/hydroplaning need wet weather; snow squalls, bridge
  ice, and shaded-grade black ice need snow; fog brake-lights need fog;
  crosswind and dust storms need high wind in open regions; rockfall and
  runaway-truck need mountain terrain; deer/elk are dawn/dusk/night-biased
  with regional species. Follow-up ideas: tie hazard *frequency* to
  corridor traffic density and proximity to metros; seasonal weather so
  snow is winter-only; condition animal strikes on rural vs urban miles.

### Driving feel

- [x] **Windows event-voice interruption crash (issue #85).** Urgent road
  alerts now use the speech backend's atomic interrupt-and-speak operation
  instead of issuing a separate SAPI stop immediately beforehand.
- [x] **Fair enforcement after lower speed signs (issues #80 and #87).** A
  driver who releases the accelerator now gets the braking time a loaded truck
  needs before a lower posted limit can produce a speeding strike. Continuing
  on the throttle forfeits the grace.
- [x] **Repeat destination-exit recovery (issues #84 and #90).** Every missed
  destination exit now reroutes the delivery back through a full approach
  window; the second miss can no longer leave the trip pinned at zero miles.
- [x] **Over-rev damage is now audible while it happens.** Sustained redline
  (easiest by backing up fast for a long stretch: the road-coupled RPM pins at
  `max_rpm`) silently ground the truck down 0.8%/s and only surfaced on the
  end screen (issue #62). The driving loop now plays the warning cue and
  speaks the rising damage total, repeating while it persists, with a short
  grace so shift flares stay quiet. Follow-up if wanted: a governor that cuts
  throttle at redline, and a reverse-speed cap, so sustained redline damage
  is hard to reach at all.
- [x] **Don't bind a controller when the controller setting is off.**
  `ControllerManager.__init__` opens the first pad unconditionally; with the
  setting disabled the game still enumerates and binds (issue #61: a fight
  stick got picked up despite controller-off). Gate `_open_first()` and the
  device-added hot-plug path on `enabled`, and open on `set_enabled(True)`.
- [x] **Verify the controller off/on toggle does not double button events.**
  Disabling now quits the SDL controller subsystem and re-enabling calls
  `init()` again mid-session, which the `_reopen()` docstring warns
  re-registers SDL's controller event watch so every event arrives twice
  (PR #67 review). Play-verified with a real pad (2026-07-12): several
  off/on toggle cycles in Settings, then button presses in menus -- no
  doubled events on current pygame, so no follow-up needed. If duplicates
  ever appear after a pygame upgrade, the fix is to make disable only close
  the pad and keep the initialized subsystem alive, reserving `_sdl.quit()`
  for `shutdown()`.
- [x] **Speed-dependent tire pitch and road-seam thumps.** Tire hum pitches
  up and down dynamically with speed on supported audio systems, with a
  distinct sound and controller pulse for road seams (PR #114).
- **Gear / launch realism.** Partly addressed: gross mass is now
  cargo-weight-aware (tare + payload), so a heavy load accelerates slower,
  lugs on grades, and burns more fuel, and an empty deadhead is light and
  brisk -- the truck mass is no longer a flat 36 t. **Still open:** the
  launch itself is too brisk even fully loaded, because it is
  traction-limited at ~0.33 g and the automatic upshifts almost instantly
  (`AUTO_UPSHIFT_RPM` 1750). Remaining options: lower the effective launch
  traction / drive force at low speed and/or widen the low-gear dwell
  before the auto upshifts. Needs playtesting to avoid feeling sluggish to
  the point of frustration.

### Speed limits and speeding

- [x] **Corridor highway speed limits.** Shipped: `speed_limit_at` now
  derives the open-road limit from `corridor_speed_limit(highway, region)`
  -- Interstate vs US highway vs state route, with rural Interstates faster
  out West (e.g. great_basin 80, southern_plains/rockies 75) -- and drops to
  an urban limit within `URBAN_RADIUS_MI` of a city. Changes are spoken as a
  GPS cue, zone-exit restores the corridor limit (not a flat 70), and the
  speeding check is judged against it.

- [x] **Real OSM `maxspeed`.** Shipped and baked: every one of the 438 legs now
  carries a `speed_limits` profile -- a step function of real posted limits from
  OpenStreetMap `maxspeed` (mph, normalized at build time) -- and
  `_corridor_limit_at` prefers it, falling back to `corridor_speed_limit(highway,
  region)` only where a leg has no baked profile. The urban-near-city reduction
  and the spoken limit-change cue are unchanged. The full bake produced 3,113
  samples (227 truck-specific `maxspeed:hgv`), correctly capturing Western 80 mph
  Great Basin stretches, California/Oregon truck-55/60, and Texas 85 mph.
  - Pipeline (local PBF, primary): `tools/build_interchanges.py --maxspeed`
    reuses the interchange reader to stream `maxspeed`/`maxspeed:hgv` off the
    corridor highway ways in local per-state Geofabrik extracts
    (`~/.cache/freight-fate-osm/regions/<state>-latest.osm.pbf`, auto-selected
    from the states each leg touches), snaps them to the checked-in OSRM
    geometry, and bakes a median-smoothed step profile. Its own index cache
    (`*.maxspeed.json`) keeps the interchange cache untouched.
  - Pipeline (Overpass, fallback): `tools/enrich_routes.py --add-maxspeed` does
    the same from the public Overpass API per route point when no local extract
    is available. Both are additive and idempotent.
  - `parse_osm_maxspeed` handles `"55 mph"`, bare `"55"` (assumed mph on the
    US-only map; OSM's km/h default is available via `default_kmh`), metric
    `"90 km/h"`, `"none"`/`"signals"`, and `;`/`,` lists (first general token
    wins). Unparseable -> `None`, so the heuristic stays the backstop.

  **Re-baking:** to refresh after a map change, run `uv run --group tooling
  python tools/build_interchanges.py --maxspeed --force --write` (per-state
  extracts auto-selected; `--only 'From->To'` for one leg). The bake is
  network-free (cached OSRM geometry or local route-point interpolation) and
  idempotent. The heuristic stays the backstop for any future leg OSM has no
  `maxspeed` on.

- [x] **Speeding leeway and consequences.** Shipped: when a strike is recorded
  (`_update_speeding`), the cab now speaks the running speeding-fine total
  immediately ("Speeding strike. The limit is 65. Speeding fines now total 160
  dollars, due at delivery."), and says when the fine has hit its cap, instead
  of the cost only surfacing as a silent settlement deduction. The leeway and
  hold window are now named constants (`SPEEDING_LEEWAY_MPH = 9`,
  `SPEEDING_HOLD_S = 6`) and judged against the leg's real OSM limit. The
  trooper milestone (below) remains the home for *visible, immediate*
  enforcement: getting pulled over and on-the-spot fines.

- [x] **Speed keeper for low-speed zones.** Shipped: K starts a job-scoped speed-control session that uses the speed keeper on facility roads, in gate queues, work zones, and congestion, then automatically hands off to adaptive cruise on the open road. It pauses through the planned pickup, persists through pickup saves, and resumes once the loaded truck is rolling. It restores the chosen cruise target across zones, follows queued traffic, and eases to ramp speed when the destination exit is announced before releasing control on the ramp. It fully disarms on other braking or hazards so it cannot restart unexpectedly. On by default, toggleable in Settings, Gameplay.
- [ ] **Driving assistance presets and descent control.** Built and then withdrawn from the 1.8 nightly line after playtesting (the underlying assists need the 1.9 driving arc around them); the work lives on feat/career-1.9 and ships with 1.9. Release-merge note: the withdrawal was a git revert of merge 9b406fe (plus 9f2dbff and b971684) on dev, so merging feat/career-1.9 back will NOT re-apply this content on its own -- the release merge must first revert the revert commit on dev, then merge.
- [x] **Limit-aware adaptive cruise.** Shipped: once real OSM limits, zones,
  and trooper enforcement landed, plain "hold the set speed" cruise would carry
  the driver straight through an urban drop into strikes and pull-overs. Cruise
  now caps its target at the posted limit plus a small offset
  (`ACC_LIMIT_OFFSET_MPH = 5`, a with-traffic pace under the 9 mph strike
  threshold), brakes gently down to a lower limit, and announces once when it
  eases off. Still follows slower traffic and widens its gap in bad weather.
  Plus and Minus adjust the set point by `CRUISE_STEP_MPH` (the real
  Accel/Coast buttons), so you engage once rolling and dial the target up to the
  speed you want; the truck accelerates up to it, capped by the limit offset.
- [x] **Grade-aware adaptive cruise, and grades you can hear coming.** Shipped
  on the 1.8.x nightly line from a player report: cruise could only add
  throttle, so a downgrade carried the truck fifteen-plus mph past the set
  speed in silence and into a fine. `Truck.hold_throttle` now feed-forwards the
  grade under the wheels and P/I only trims from there; over the target cruise
  takes the engine brake and snubs the drums when that is not enough, holding
  the set speed on grades to eight percent with full air and cool shoes. It
  hands back only the engine brake it switched on itself. Alongside it, a
  spoken advisory for any grade of 3 percent or more lasting at least three
  quarters of a mile (short dips filtered out -- unfiltered, Knoxville to
  Asheville spoke 76 advisories in 116 miles), a once-per-grade line when
  cruise concedes the hill, and the G key for the slope under the wheels, its
  run, the truck's verdict, and the next steep grade ahead.
- [x] **`tools/playtest_road.py`: drop into a chosen piece of road.** Built
  alongside the grade work, because walking the menus to a specific hill takes
  minutes and lands somewhere slightly different every time. Finds a road
  feature by evidence (`--find downgrade|upgrade|zone|limit-drop|stop`, with
  `--scan` to list candidates), then starts the real game already rolling at
  it with the truck, cargo, weather, hour, and cruise set as asked -- or
  `--headless N` for a speed/gear/jake/air trace instead of a window. Searching
  reads the world data alone, so `--scan` never opens a window. Its sibling
  `tools/playtest.py` still drives a whole delivery headlessly for transcripts.
- [ ] Follow-ups the dev line does not have: staged retarder control (dev's
  engine brake is one switch, so cruise holds by cycling it against the
  throttle rather than picking a stage), the predictive read of the grade
  ahead, and a pull downshift for climbs the automatic currently rides out in
  top gear. All three exist on `feat/career-1.9`; the merge takes 1.9's side.

- [x] **Window-model on-time bonus.** Shipped on the 1.8.x nightly line:
  `Job.payout` used to scale its on-time bonus by unused deadline (max 15%
  only for a near-instant delivery, a few percent in practice), which
  rewarded racing the clock and paid almost nothing for normal on-time runs.
  It now pays a flat 10% for any delivery inside the window, the way real
  shipper scorecards (OTIF-style) pay for service; late/damage penalties are
  unchanged. Compared against feat/career-1.9 before landing: 1.9's carrier
  pay plans add their own flat on-time share (2-6% of gross) plus reputation
  trust pay (max 6%) *on top of* gross, and its `Job.payout` is identical to
  dev's, so this reshapes the shared gross curve and merges cleanly; watch
  the combined stack (10% gross + carrier share + trust) when rebalancing
  the 1.9 economy.

- [x] **Tapered dispatch minimums.** The flat $700-1050 pay floors (clamped at
  the level-3 values forever) paid a 50-mile hop ~$23 a mile — four to five
  times any long haul — so grinding short hops was strictly optimal once load
  choice unlocked. `minimum_pay_for_level` now guarantees a short-haul rate
  premium ($4.70-5.50/mi by level, holding to 100 mi) that tapers linearly to
  $3.20-3.50/mi at 600 mi, where the untouched long-haul minimums (levels 4+)
  take over, plus a small $300-350 "worth rolling the truck" floor. Mid/long
  totals stay within a few percent of the old floors; only sub-~200-mi pay
  came down. Landed on dev and feat/career-1.9 together (1.9's
  direct-freight multiplier stacks on top, unchanged). Watch early-career
  cash pacing (rookie sub-150-mi jobs pay ~30-60% less; truck purchase
  timing may shift) when tuning the 1.9 arc.

### Realism north star (ongoing)

The guiding goal for 1.8 and beyond: make every system as true to real
trucking as the 2-D, audio-first design allows, short of a 3-D driving
model. New realism ideas land here, then graduate into a concrete slice
above when picked up. Existing items already serving this goal: grounded
hazards (done), corridor speed limits, gear/launch realism, drowsiness
consequences, and the trooper/enforcement milestone below.

Net-new realism candidates, roughly by area:

- [x] **Weather and seasons.** Shipped: the career clock now yields a day of
  the year and season, and `sim/season.py` models a regional temperature
  (seasonal + daily swing). Temperature reconciles the simulated draw --
  precipitation falls as snow when freezing, snow thaws to rain when warm,
  storms need warmth -- so snow is a cold-season risk and thunderstorms a
  warm-season one, and the weather-gated hazards inherit that automatically
  (winter ice/squalls, summer hail). Seasons are opt-in via `WeatherSystem`'s
  `game_hours` so seed-based tests stay deterministic; real-weather mode keeps
  driving conditions (and thus hazard context) from live data, and with live
  weather on the season follows the real-world calendar by default so it
  matches those conditions. Players can now turn off **Live weather controls
  calendar** to keep live conditions while the career date and seasons
  advance; established careers anchor that independent calendar to today's
  date at the handoff while new careers retain the March 21 start. A seasonal reconciliation guard prevents summer snow and
  cold-season thunderstorms in that mode. Real observation temperature is now extracted too (`_temp_to_c`
  -> `RealWeatherProvider.get_temperature` -> `WeatherSystem._temperature`), so
  live mode reports the station's real degrees and falls back to the climate
  model only when a reading is missing. Weather also bites mechanically now,
  not just as flavor: the per-condition aero `drag_mult` is applied to the
  physics (storms/wind cost top speed and fuel), driving well over the
  conditions-safe speed on a slick road risks a traction-loss incident
  (`_check_conditions_speed`), and low visibility shortens hazard reaction time
  (`_visibility_reaction_factor`). Remaining follow-ups: black-ice risk on clear
  cold mornings after wet roads (currently ice rides on active snow); steady
  crosswind nudging the trailer; and seasonal daylight length. Live-weather fog
  is now gated on the station's measured visibility (NWS "Fog/Mist"/"Haze" at
  6+ miles played as pea-soup fog before).
- [ ] **Live-weather staleness fallback.** If the network drops mid-trip,
  `RealWeatherProvider.unavailable()` still reports a city as available while
  its cache entry is stale (>30 min), so `WeatherSystem.update()` holds the
  last live condition indefinitely instead of falling back to simulated
  weather. Treat a stale-only cache as offline (and consider a spoken note
  when live weather falls back) so conditions can't silently freeze.
- [x] **Per-truck condition tracking.** Every owned truck now keeps its own
  fuel, damage, tire wear, and road grime (save version 5); newly bought
  trucks arrive fueled and fresh, and switching trucks no longer carries or
  loses fuel. Older saves are migrated automatically on load, with a one-time
  spoken notice that the save is no longer readable by older versions.
- [ ] **Teach the server-side validation gate and cloud-save consumers the
  `truck_conditions` shape.** The client invariants and docs are updated for
  save version 5, but the server plausibility rules still describe the flat
  pre-v5 condition fields.
- [x] **Mid-drive quit writes a self-consistent save.** Quit to main menu now
  rolls hours of service and fatigue back to the active-trip checkpoint the
  player will actually resume from, instead of persisting the shift accrued
  since the last stop (PR #146).
- [ ] **Close the same gap on the window-close path.** `App.shutdown()` saves
  the profile unconditionally, so closing the window mid-drive still writes the
  drifted hours of service and fatigue. Resuming re-restores both from the
  active-trip snapshot, so gameplay is unaffected, but the on-disk save and its
  cloud backup disagree with their own checkpoint until then.
- [ ] **Decide whether mid-drive money should roll back too.** Speeding fines
  and roadside fees deduct from the profile as they happen, so a mid-drive quit
  keeps money lost after the last stop while the position, hours, and fatigue
  all rewind to it. Either commit the charge deliberately or restore it with
  the rest of the checkpoint.
- **Physics and the truck.** Cargo-weight-aware gross mass is done for
  acceleration, grade lugging, fuel burn, and now braking: the foundation
  brakes have a fixed force ceiling sized for the rated gross, so loads over
  the rated weight are brake-capacity limited -- they stop longer and heat
  the brakes faster -- while loads at or below the rated gross are unchanged.
  Remaining: tire and brake wear over a truck's life, and finer grade-based
  fuel burn.
- **Traffic and corridors.** Hazard and congestion frequency scaled by how
  busy a corridor actually is (urban interstates dense, empty plains
  sparse); rush-hour slowdowns near metros; realistic merge/exit traffic.
- **Hours of service.** Split-sleeper provision and the 60/70-hour cycle
  with 34-hour restart (the HOS model intentionally skips these today).
- **Local delivery realism.** The destination-local approach legs already
  sketched under World: surface-street miles, gate speeds, and dock
  approaches after the highway portion.
- **Business realism.** The company-driver→owner-operator arc, loans, and
  insurance already sketched under Business.
- [x] **One message-review system, working on every screen.** The two
  overlapping histories (the app-level speech ring and the driving state's
  message log) are now a single bounded log; every review key -- step, jump to
  oldest/newest, filter by category, copy to clipboard -- is offered to each
  state by the app rather than wired into individual screens (issue #134).
  Remaining: an in-game review screen that lists the history rather than
  stepping through it one message at a time, and a player setting for how many
  messages to keep.
- [x] **National hub network fill (407 → 623 cities).** Audit-driven map
  expansion on the 1.8.x nightly line (community PR #68): every >10,000-pop
  independent city without a bigger neighbor within ~30 miles was built with
  the full enrichment recipe -- 1,287 legs, ~139,000 network miles, real toll
  events on the major turnpikes, and posted speed limits on every leg.

## Planned for 1.8: in-cab logbook (Record of Duty Status)

The game talks about an ELD and the shipped `TrafficStopState` already runs a
spoken "license/logbook check," but there is no actual logbook behind it. Today's
`HosClock` (`sim/hos.py`) is an aggregate ledger -- it accumulates driving, duty,
and since-break minutes and tracks the current duty status, but keeps no
chronological history. A real ELD logbook is a Record of Duty Status (RODS): a
timeline of duty-status segments with timestamps and locations. 1.8 adds that,
and graduates the trooper logbook check from cosmetic narration to reading real
entries. (The 60/70-hour cycle and 34-hour restart that a RODS window would
unlock are deferred to a later milestone.)

### Design sketch

- **Data model.** A `DutyLog` of ordered `DutySegment`s: status (the existing
  `DUTY_STATUSES` -- driving / on_duty_not_driving / off_duty / sleeper_berth),
  start and end hour on the career clock (`profile.game_hours`), a short location
  string ("I-90 near Toledo", "Chicago terminal"), and an optional note ("fuel
  stop", "out-of-service order").
- **Recording with coalescing.** `drive()` runs every frame, so the log must not
  append a row per tick. `DutyLog.record(status, now_hour, location)` extends the
  current segment when the status is unchanged and only opens a new one on an
  actual transition, capturing location where the segment starts (as real RODS
  logs location at status changes). A continuous driving stint becomes one row,
  on-ramp to rest stop.
- **Architecture.** Keep `HosClock` pure and pygame-free (the headless tests
  drive it directly). The `DutyLog` lives on the `Profile` alongside `hos`, and
  is recorded from the layer that already knows the absolute clock and place --
  the driving/city/rest code that calls `_advance_rest_clock` and
  `hos.drive/on_duty/off_duty`. `DutyLog` stays unit-testable standalone. Prune
  to a rolling ~8-day window (192 game-hours) to bound save size.
- **Persistence.** Additive `duty_log` field in `Profile.to_dict`/`from_dict`
  with a tolerant load like `HosClock.from_dict`; absent in old saves means an
  empty log. Fully backward compatible.
- **Player surface.** A fully spoken Logbook screen (first-letter nav, consistent
  with the rest of the UI), reachable from the city menu and the driving Tab
  status menu. Shows current status, today's hours-in-each-status grid, the
  running limits the clock already computes, and a chronological list of recent
  segments ("7:00 AM-11:30 AM, driving, 4.5 hrs, I-90 from Chicago"). No new
  global hotkey needed -- C and Tab already cover live HOS.
- **Real enforcement (in scope for 1.8).** `TrafficStopState`'s logbook check
  reads the recorded RODS instead of only the `hos_violation` flag, and cites
  specifics in the spoken stop and evidence ("11.5 hours driving since your last
  10-hour reset") rather than a generic "HOS/ELD violation."

## State troopers and law enforcement

Speeding, HOS/ELD compliance, and route enforcement are now one visible
system instead of unrelated end-of-trip deductions and generic random
inspections. The first shipped slice uses route-backed contexts where the
current corridor data supports them: weigh-station POIs, construction
zones, checkpoints/high-patrol corridors, and seeded patrol windows.
Events carry evidence such as HOS/ELD violations or construction-zone
speeding, and serious HOS violations trigger an out-of-service 10-hour
reset instead of only a fine.

- [x] **Speeding pull-overs (interactive traffic stop).** Shipped: routes seed
  `PatrolWindow`s by highway class, region, and time of day (`Trip._place_patrols`
  / `active_patrol_at`), construction zones always hot, scaled down by relaxed
  mode's `hazard_scale`. A sustained speeding strike inside a window rolls
  against patrol intensity (`DrivingState._trooper_catches_speeder`); a hit lights
  you up (`events/police_siren`), you signal with X and brake to a stop, and
  `TrafficStopState` runs a spoken license/logbook check ending in an immediate
  on-the-spot ticket (`SPEEDING_TICKET_FINES`, paid now) or a warning; a prompt,
  fully-compliant stop has a small chance a ticket is waived to a warning. A
  behavior-based compliance tracker (seeded at `PULL_OVER_START_COMPLIANCE`,
  raised by braking, lowered by accelerating/coasting/failing to signal) judges
  the stop -- refusing to comply zeroes it out and is logged as an evasion/felony
  rather than the old distance rule. Disabled in the
  debug HOS bypass. Uncaught speeding still accrues the silent settlement strike.
  Real ElevenLabs audio is in: `events/police_siren.ogg` (used now),
  `events/spike_strip.ogg` (felony-stop sound on evasion), and
  `events/cb_radio_chatter.ogg` (staged for the CB slice). Regenerate via
  `tools/generate_sounds.py`.
  *Next trooper slices:* the CB-radio heads-up mechanic ("bear at mile marker
  12"), a full felony stop (losing the load), weigh-station "blow past while
  flagged", damage-triggered stops.

The ELD/HOS model is grounded in FMCSA's property-carrier summary:
11 hours of driving after 10 consecutive hours off duty, a 14-hour
driving window after coming on duty, a 30-minute break after 8 cumulative
driving hours that may be any non-driving period, and 60/70-hour cycle
rules with 34-hour restart as a future expansion. Primary references:
https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-service/summary-hours-service-regulations
and https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-of-service. ELD save data
records duty status, time, and route evidence in the spirit of FMCSA's ELD
function guidance: https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/hours-service/elds/eld-functions-faqs.

### Design sketch

- **Patrol presence.** Each route leg gets a patrol intensity from its
  region and highway (urban corridors hot, empty plains cold, construction
  zones always hot), modulated by time of day (speed traps at rush hour,
  DUI patrols at night). The CB radio is the counterplay: chatter like
  "bear at mile marker 12" gives attentive players a spoken heads-up a
  few miles out.
- **Getting pulled over.** Speeding 10+ over inside a patrol's window (or
  blowing past a weigh station while flagged) triggers a siren behind you.
  The player must signal with X (reusing the exit system's muscle memory),
  brake to a stop on the shoulder, and sit through a spoken stop: license
  and logbook check, then a ticket, a warning (reputation and demeanor
  matter), or an order to a nearby weigh station for a full inspection.
- **Consequences.** Immediate fines replace the silent at-delivery
  deduction (escalating like HOS fines: 150 to 1,200 dollars), reputation
  hits, and an "out of service" order for serious HOS violations: 10
  hours parked where you stand. Ignoring the siren is a felony stop:
  spike strips ahead, a huge fine, and possibly losing the load.
- **Settings.** HOS defaults to realistic and keeps relaxed for
  accessibility and pacing. There is no player-facing non-enforced mode:
  enforcement-off survives only as an internal developer bypass
  (`debug_off`), and legacy 1.5.0 "off" saves now load as realistic. A
  separate law-enforcement setting remains open only if enforcement grows
  beyond HOS and route safety evidence.
- **Audio needed.** Siren approach/behind loops, CB radio squelch and
  chatter, an officer voice channel (the SAPI event voice fits), spike
  strip. Added as Ogg Vorbis assets under
  `src/freight_fate/assets/sounds/`.
- **Open questions.** Should troopers notice damage (a visibly wrecked
  truck invites a stop)? Do warnings expire? Does reputation lower the
  ticket odds, or just the fine?

- [x] Day/night cycle with audio shifts (1.5.0); seasons and a regional
      temperature model now shipped too
- [ ] City-specific ambience and landmarks
- [ ] Destination-local facility legs: after the highway trip reaches the
      destination city, hand the player onto a short local approach to the
      receiver gate. Route display and GPS cues should clearly separate
      highway miles from local gate approach, saves should resume on the
      correct leg, and facility data should carry enough road name, distance,
      gate speed, and dock-approach detail to make warehouses, terminals,
      ports, and industrial yards feel distinct.
- [ ] International expansion, beginning with research into Canada and the
      United Kingdom: country profiles need driving side, units, currency,
      local trucking terms, hours-of-service rules, weather fallbacks, legal
      routing, and border-crossing behavior before routes can ship.

### In-cab radio (1.8 / 1.9 candidate)

A truck radio you can tune as you drive: pull in the local FM stations for
wherever you are on the map, with a satellite-style network as the
always-available fallback when you are out of range of anything local. A
community suggestion; the right kind of immersion for long hauls and a natural
fit for an audio-first game.

- **Direction (decided):** use real stations via their public internet stream
  URLs (a friend has a curated list). The game is free and non-commercial, and
  it acts as a *tuner* -- it points the player's own client at a stream the
  station already broadcasts publicly, not hosting or rebroadcasting audio
  (the TuneIn / car-head-unit model). Free and non-commercial is not a blanket
  copyright exemption, but the tuner-to-public-stream posture plus no money
  changing hands keeps practical risk low for a small game.

- **Streamer-safe toggle still required.** Independent of the game's own
  posture: a player who streams a session to YouTube/Twitch with copyrighted
  station audio can still get the VOD struck. So real-stream radio stays an
  explicit toggle (and a "mute radio for streaming" switch), with an owned
  royalty-free station and the satellite fallback as the always-safe default
  audio, so streamers are protected unless they opt in.

- **Geography-gated reception.** Stations are data, not magic: a JSON catalog
  per station with call sign, format/genre, public stream URL and its audio
  format (so the loader can skip unsupported transports), transmitter
  latitude/longitude, ERP (effective radiated power), and antenna HAAT, plus a
  derived `range_miles`. Range is estimated from public FCC license data (FM Query /
  LMS) using the F(50,50) protected-contour idea -- power and antenna height,
  refined by terrain -- so you can only pull in stations whose coverage
  actually reaches you. The truck's geo-position is interpolated in
  latitude/longitude along the current route leg (cities already carry
  lat/lon), signal strength falls off toward the edge of a station's contour,
  and reception fades into static and drops out as you leave range -- then the
  next town's stations fade in.

- **Satellite fallback: AFN.** An always-available station for when no local
  FM is in range -- AFN (American Forces Network), which has exactly the right
  always-on, ad-free, slightly-institutional vibe. AFN's *overseas over-the-air
  and decoder-box* broadcasts are encrypted, but its internet radio (AFN 360)
  is publicly streamable to anyone, so it can be used directly. Public stream
  URL (Triton/StreamTheWorld, AFN Pacific):
  `https://playerservices.streamtheworld.com/api/livestream-redirect/AFNP_OKN_SC`.
  AFN is ad-free and U.S. government-produced, but the music it airs is still
  commercially licensed, so the streamer-safe toggle still applies to it. This
  is the one station that is always in range, so it doubles as the graceful
  fallback when a local stream rots or drops out.

- **Audio sourcing: real streams, with the real work being technical not
  legal.** The friend's stream-URL list is the primary source. The gotchas to
  build around: (1) streams rot -- URLs change and stations go dark, so
  reception must fail gracefully and fall back to the satellite/owned station,
  never dead air or a crash; (2) codec/transport -- the BASS/sound_lib backend
  handles Icecast/Shoutcast MP3/AAC easily, but HLS (`.m3u8`) needs more work,
  so the catalog should record stream format and the loader should skip
  unsupported ones; (3) some stations geo-block or require their own app, so a
  few URLs won't work for a third-party player and the catalog needs a
  reachable/working flag. Keep an owned royalty-free station and the satellite
  fallback for offline play and the streamer-safe default.

- **Accessibility is the feature, not a checkbox.** Tuning must be fully
  spoken and keyboard-driven: seek/scan up and down the dial, announce call
  sign + format + signal strength, audibly fade as you move in and out of
  range, a station list and favorites, and a dedicated radio volume in
  Settings. This is core UX for the game's audience, designed in from the
  start.

- **Ties to existing systems.** Reuses regions and city lat/lon, the music
  backend, and the day/night + seasons clock (programming could shift by time
  of day or season). Open questions: ship the full FCC-derived dataset or a
  curated subset; how granular the range/terrain model needs to be; and
  per-genre licensing for any owned music library.

### Business
- [ ] Company-driver to owner-operator career arc. Resolve the current
      thematic mismatch: the mechanics are already owner-operator (you buy and
      upgrade your own trucks and pay fuel, repairs, and tolls), but the
      progression flavor reads like a company driver. Reframe as a single arc --
      *start* as a company driver (paid per mile, no asset costs or fixed
      overhead), then earn your way to owning a truck, at which point fuel,
      maintenance, insurance, and any loan payment come out of revenue. Expand
      the career ladder (~20 levels; today `LEVEL_XP` tables 9 then +1500/level)
      to pace that transition and the matching upgrade unlocks.
- [ ] Company ownership: hire AI drivers, buy trucks
- [ ] Loans and insurance

### Platforms and community
- [x] Binary releases (Nuitka) per platform
- [ ] Steam/itch.io distribution
- [ ] Localization of all speech strings
- [ ] Optional online leaderboards
- [x] Opt-in Profile sharing for fictional road journals, achievements, and last-saved profile summaries
- [x] Online posts carry the game's build identity (release tag or source checkout) so moderation can tell which version a driver runs
- [x] Validated and server-signed private cloud revisions with verified public profile summaries
- [x] Profile integrity, client half: `profile_invariants.py` runs the hard, version-stable sanity rules (ranges, counter relations, upgrade tiers) as defense in depth behind the Ed25519 signature on every cloud restore, refusing with a plain spoken reason; `docs/profile-invariants.md` is the maintained validation list for the server gate. Follow-up: the append-only event ledger that upgrades server validation from plausibility to recomputation
- [x] Packed save container: careers live in signed `.ffsave` files (magic header + deflated JSON) that text editors cannot open; legacy plain-JSON saves convert on load with a `.json.bak` rollback copy. A failed local signature now marks the profile `integrity_modified` (sticky, signed-in, spoken once) instead of quarantining — local play continues, shared features read the mark. `tools/dump_save.py` prints the JSON inside a save for bug reports.
- [ ] Retire legacy plain-JSON save loading (and its unsigned amnesty) once converted installs are the norm — one or two releases after the container ships; the amnesty is the last casual editing door
- [ ] Ship a stable release carrying the packed save container, so players are not split across two save formats. Until one exists, a career backed up from a developer snapshot cannot be restored onto 1.8.3: the snapshot writes the newer format, and the stable build drops the fields it does not recognise. Moving forward (stable career onto a snapshot) is fine. Fixing the backwards direction in the client was considered and deliberately declined — too many edge cases for the value; the stable release is the fix. Told players so on issue #97, without naming a date.
- [x] Cloud backup accepts every shipped save shape, not just the newest build's: the orinks.net validator matches uploads against a superset allow-list and a supported version range, and only requires the fields it actually reads. It had demanded an exact match with whichever build the invariants export was last generated from, which refused newer and older saves in turn — most recently every save from 1.8.3, the stable release, leaving those players unable to back up at all (issue #97)
- [ ] Server absolution for `integrity_modified`: a profile that passes full server validation may have the client mark cleared on the next verified restore, so honest cross-machine movers are not marked forever (`docs/server-integrity-handoff.md`)
- [x] Driver token in the platform secret store: the secret half of the online credentials goes to Windows Credential Manager, the macOS Keychain, or Secret Service/KWallet on Linux via `keyring`, leaving only the public Driver ID in `online.json`. Tokens written by earlier builds migrate on the next load, with no re-paste. A machine with no working store (headless Linux) falls back to an owner-only `online.token` opened at 0600 (community PR #133, reworked cross-platform)
- [ ] Sign out from inside the game: there is no way to unlink a computer from the game side, so the stored token outlives an uninstall. Needs a Cloud/Online menu action that clears `online.json`, the secret-store entry, and any fallback token file, plus the corresponding revoke on the orinks.net computer list
- [x] Per-computer driver tokens on orinks.net: each computer gets its own token from a named, revocable computer list on the driver setup page, so connecting a second computer no longer retires the first one's sign-in (issue #64; game-side reconnect guidance points at the computer list)
- [x] Copy the delivery summary to the clipboard from the delivery complete screen (verified by read-back before the game says "copied")
- [x] Delete a career's cloud backups from the Cloud backup menu: a confirmed, safe-default-first delete removes every kept revision from the account (server DELETE route + existing `deleteSaveSlot` mutation); local saves untouched, sync state forgotten so a still-local career starts a fresh slot on its next save
- [x] Opt-in Mastodon sharing of notable deliveries: the player links their own Mastodon account on orinks.net (any instance, dynamic app registration, `read:accounts write:statuses` scope), and the game offers deliveries that earned an achievement, level, or streak milestone; the server composes the public post from allowlisted facts and adds the #FreightFateRuns hashtag (deliberately not the bare #FreightFate, which players use for their own posts -- muting the bot must not mute the conversation). Off by default, separate consent from Profile sharing, durable outbox client-side
- [ ] Mastodon sharing follow-ups: unlink from inside the game (today the orinks.net page is the only unlink), and consider per-post visibility choice (public vs unlisted) if players ask
- [x] Activation-code setup replaces clipboard-paste credentials: connecting
      a computer to orinks.net now shows a short activation code (spoken,
      spellable phonetically, and copyable to the clipboard) instead of
      requiring a Driver ID and token to be copied from the website and
      pasted into the game; the game polls and finishes connecting on its
      own once the code is confirmed in the browser (`online_activation.py`,
      device-code exchange already live on orinks.net)
- [x] First-career onboarding offer: creating a first career now offers,
      once, to connect the computer to an orinks.net account -- right after
      "Welcome aboard" and before the dispatch board (`states/online_offer.py`,
      gated by the per-install `Settings.online_offer_seen`, never asked again
      once seen or once a computer is already connected). Declining (or
      Escape, which behaves the same) and accepting both continue straight
      into the city menu either way. The offer deliberately does not claim
      connecting turns on cloud backup or the drivers board -- both stay off
      until chosen separately, from Online.
- [x] Idle drivers age off the live board: a truck parked with the game left running (not paused) signs off after 30 minutes without a snapshot change and stops heartbeating (`online_presence.py` IDLE_SIGNOFF_S); the server hides still-beating idle rows on the same clock for older builds (orinks-net `PRESENCE_IDLE_MS` + per-row `changedAt`), and deadhead presence now carries progress so a long empty run never reads as idle
- [x] Online hub: the drivers board, orinks.net account, cloud backup and restore, and all sharing toggles moved from Settings into one Online menu on the main menu (`states/online_hub.py`); Settings keeps an Online pointer that opens the same menu for a release or two
- [ ] Remove the Settings Online pointer once players have had a release or two to relearn the location
- [x] The drivers-board progress percent is readable in-game: the R route report leads with "N percent there" (`Trip.progress_percent`, same position/total figure presence posts) and the Tab status menu carries a Progress line; deadhead drives included
- [x] Braille-friendly driving readouts: the on-demand C, R, V, and F reports front-load the answer so the first line of a one-line braille display carries it (displays are 14 to 80 cells, commonly 40, and screen readers flash game speech one line at a time); terse speech additionally trims the C report to time, verdict, and hours of service
- [ ] Braille pass over the remaining spoken surfaces (event announcements, menus, arrival and settlement summaries): same front-loading rule, and check flash-message length against a 40-cell display
